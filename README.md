Auto-Reverse-SSH for iOS
================
Short Description:
Automatically forwards a port on start-up using autossh on iOS

About The Project:
Auto Reverse SSH is a project that I have created in order to 
transparently maintain access to a device sitting behind a NAT 
firewall like those found on mobile data connections or networks 
that we don't have control over such as WiFi hotspots & guest 
networks. This works by "forwarding" a port of your choice 
(I forward SSH) to another SSH server that you have access
to from the outside. 

What This Repo Contains:
This repository includes the .deb package, .deb "source" 
files, bash scripts & launch daemons that I made to 
automatically execute autossh on start-up for iOS
with the the necessary parameters.

Note:
I am still in the process of learning to use github 
appropriately
